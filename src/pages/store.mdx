# Store

Simple observable store that can also be used inside React using Hooks. This observable is accompanied by [@corets/value](/value) and [@corets/list](/list).

```bash
yarn add @corets/store
```

## React

You can use stores inside React through this hooks based integration [@corets/use-store](/use-store).

## LocalStorage

There is also a version of this library that syncs its state to the localStorage: [@corets/local-storage-store](/local-storage-store)


## `createStore`

Creates a new instance of `Store`:

```ts
import { createStore } from "@corets/store"

const store = createStore({some: "data"})
```

Create a new instance without the factory function:

```ts
import { Store } from "@corets/store"

const store = new Store({some: "data"})
```

## `Store.get`

Retrieve value from store:

```ts
store.get()
```

## `Store.set`

Replace value in store:

```ts
store.set({ foo: "bar" })
```

## `Store.put`

Add some values without replacing the initial state:

```ts
store.put({ some: "data" })
```

## `Store.reset`

Reset store to the initial state that has been provided during its creation:

```ts
store.reset()
```

You can also reset with a new state:

```ts
store.reset({ other: "data" })
```

## `Store.listen`

Listen to any changes:

```ts
store.listen((value) => console.log(value))
```
