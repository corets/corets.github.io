# Value

Simple observable value that can also be used inside React using Hooks. This observable is accompanied by [@corets/list](/list) and [@corets/store](/store).

```bash
yarn add @corets/value
```

## React

You can use values inside React through this hooks based integration [@corets/use-value](/use-value).

## LocalStorage

There is also a version of this library that syncs its state to the localStorage: [@corets/local-storage-value](/local-storage-value)

## `createValue`

Creates a new instance of `Value`:

```ts
import { createValue } from "@corets/value"

const count = createValue(0)
```

Create a new instance without the factory function:

```ts
import { Value } from "@corets/value"

const value = new Value(0)
```

## `Value.get`

Retrieve value:

```ts
value.get()
```

## `Value.set`

Replace value:

```ts
value.set(2)
```

## `Value.reset`

Reset value to the initial state that has been provided during its creation:

```ts
value.reset()
```

You can also reset with a new state:

```ts
value.reset(3)
```

## `Value.listen`

Listen to any changes:

```ts
value.listen((value) => console.log(value))
```
